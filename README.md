All authored assets live under `src/site`. The `public/` directory is generated at build time and should not be edited by hand.

## Building & Deployment

```bash
npm install            # One-time setup
npm run build          # Copies src/site ? public/ and compiles Tailwind
```

The build command runs two steps:
1. `node tools/build-static.js` copies everything in `src/site` to `public/`.
2. `postcss src/tailwind.css -o public/assets/css/tailwind.css --env production` compiles Tailwind utilities for the site.

On Vercel, configure the project with:
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `public`

For local preview of the generated site:
```bash
npx serve public
# or
python -m http.server 3000 -d public
```

## Image Utilities

- `npm run optimize` – optimize slideshow images in `src/site/images/slide`
- `npm run generate:slides` – regenerate `slides.json` manifest from the slide assets

Artifacts and historical reports generated by those tools are archived in `docs/reference/`.

## Development Notes

- Tailwind content scanning is scoped to `src/site/**/*.html` and `src/site/assets/js/**/*.js`.
- Client-side logic lives in `src/site/assets/js/script.js` and `src/site/journal.js`.
- Static assets added to `src/site` will automatically be copied to the build output on the next `npm run build`.
