<div class="article-body">
  <p data-segment-id="imagenet-alexnet-2012-div-p-1">ImageNet provided a massive labeled dataset of over 1 million images across 1,000 categories, while AlexNet demonstrated that deep convolutional neural networks could dramatically outperform traditional computer vision methods on this challenging benchmark.</p>
  <p data-segment-id="imagenet-alexnet-2012-div-p-2">AlexNet's victory in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge marked a turning point, achieving a top-5 error rate of 15.3% compared to 26.2% from the second-place traditional method. This breakthrough proved that deep learning could scale to real-world problems with sufficient data and compute power.</p>
  <p data-segment-id="imagenet-alexnet-2012-div-p-3">The success launched the current era of deep learning, inspiring rapid adoption across industries and establishing convolutional neural networks as the foundation for modern computer vision systems.</p>
