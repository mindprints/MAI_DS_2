<p class="lead">The 1956 summer workshop at Dartmouth College that coined “Artificial Intelligence” and framed early research ambitions.</p>
<div class="article-body">
  <p>In the summer of 1956, a small group of researchers proposed that aspects of learning and intelligence could, in principle, be precisely described and simulated on machines. The event catalyzed research into symbolic reasoning, search, and early learning approaches, and helped establish AI as a distinct academic field.</p>
  <p>While expectations were high, the symposium also set the stage for later debates between symbolic programs and data-driven learning methods. Many lines of work that emerged here—problem solving, logic, language—remain central to AI discourse.</p>
