--><html><head></head><body><p class="lead" data-segment-id="perceptron-body-p-0">A pioneering linear classifier introduced in the late 1950s that inspired early neural network research and later critique.</p>
<div class="article-body">
  <p data-segment-id="perceptron-div-p-1">The perceptron computes a weighted sum of inputs and applies a threshold to produce a binary decision. It can learn weights from labeled examples via simple update rules. Its limitations on non-linearly separable problems became a key historical lesson, motivating multi-layer networks and new training methods.</p>
  <p data-segment-id="perceptron-div-p-2">Despite its simplicity, the perceptron remains an important foundation for understanding modern linear models and the evolution toward deep learning.</p>
