<div class="article-body">
  <p data-segment-id="ai-winter-1974-1980-div-p-1">After rapid optimism in the 1960s, the 1970s brought tougher benchmarks, critical reviews, and limited computing resources. Governments and funders grew cautious as projects under-delivered against ambitious goals in machine translation, robotics, and general problem solving.</p>
  <p data-segment-id="ai-winter-1974-1980-div-p-2">The downturn reshaped priorities and evaluation standards. While the “winter” slowed some symbolic programs, it also prepared the ground for future revivals in statistical methods, data-driven learning, and later deep learning.</p>
