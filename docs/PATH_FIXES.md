- Small-loader functioning correctly ✅

### ⚠️ Path Issues Fixed

#### Issue 1: Encyclopedia Index Pages - Incorrect Asset Paths

**Problem:** Encyclopedia index pages were using wrong relative paths for CSS/JS assets.

**English Encyclopedia:**
- Location: `public/pages/encyclopedia/index.html` (2 levels deep)
- Was using: `assetsPrefix: '..'` → resulted in `/pages/assets/css/` ❌
- Fixed to: `assetsPrefix: '../..'` → results in `/assets/css/` ✅

**Swedish Encyclopedia:**
- Location: `public/sv/pages/encyclopedia/index.html` (3 levels deep)
- Was using: `assetsPrefix: '../..'` → resulted in `/sv/assets/css/` ❌
- Fixed to: `assetsPrefix: '../../..'` → results in `/assets/css/` ✅

**File Changed:** `src/content/pages/encyclopedia.index.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
en: {
  assetsPrefix: '..',  // Wrong - only goes up 1 level
}
sv: {
  assetsPrefix: '../..',  // Wrong - only goes up 2 levels  
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
en: {
  assetsPrefix: '../..',  // Correct - goes up 2 levels to root
}
sv: {
  assetsPrefix: '../../..',  // Correct - goes up 3 levels to root
}
```

Also fixed Swedish index `indexHref` from `../../index.html` to `../../../index.html` so the "back to home" link works correctly.

## Remaining 404 Errors Explained

### Favicon 404
```
"GET /favicon.ico" Error (404)
```

**Explanation:** Browsers automatically request `/favicon.ico` from the root.

**Status:** Not a real issue - you have favicons properly configured in `<head>` with:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon/favicon.svg">
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon/favicon.ico">
```

The file exists at `/favicon/favicon.ico` but browsers also try `/favicon.ico` by default.

**Fix (Optional):** Copy `public/favicon/favicon.ico` to `public/favicon.ico` for convenience.

### Strange `/index.html/` Prefix Errors

```
"GET /index.html/admin" Error (404)
"GET /index.html/assets/css/tailwind.css" Error (404)
```

**Explanation:** These appear to be:
1. Manual typing errors in browser address bar
2. Or cached/bookmarked URLs from when something was misconfigured

**Status:** Not a code issue - these are user navigation errors or stale URLs.

## How to Apply Fixes

### 1. Rebuild Site Locally
```bash
npm run build
```

This will regenerate the encyclopedia index pages with correct paths.

### 2. Verify Local
Check that the generated files have correct paths:
```bash
# English encyclopedia
grep "tailwind.css" public/pages/encyclopedia/index.html
# Should show: ../../assets/css/tailwind.css

# Swedish encyclopedia  
grep "tailwind.css" public/sv/pages/encyclopedia/index.html
# Should show: ../../../assets/css/tailwind.css
```

### 3. Deploy to Dokploy
```bash
git add src/content/pages/encyclopedia.index.js
git commit -m "Fix: Correct asset paths in encyclopedia index pages"
git push origin main
```

Dokploy will automatically rebuild and the 404 errors will disappear.

## PostgreSQL Log Status

The PostgreSQL messages you saw are **NORMAL** and **HEALTHY**:

```
database system was not properly shut down; automatic recovery in progress
redo starts at 0/1B67D68
database system is ready to accept connections
```

**What this means:**
- Container was restarted/rebuilt (expected in Docker)
- PostgreSQL performed automatic crash recovery (standard procedure)
- Database recovered successfully and is now ready ✅

**No action needed** - this is expected behavior when Docker containers restart.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Encyclopedia index page asset paths  
✅ **Database:** Working correctly  
✅ **PostgreSQL:** Healthy and operational  
⚠️ **Favicon 404:** Cosmetic issue, not breaking anything  
⚠️ **index.html/ errors:** User navigation errors, not code issues

**Next Action:** Commit the fix and push to trigger Dokploy rebuild. All path-related 404s will be resolved.
