GPT-5 did achieve higher scores on most of the benchmarks we discussed on our post of July 24, but at the same time garnered significant disappointment from many commentators, and definitely fell short of reaching AGI status as defined by OpenAI itself:<br><br><strong>AGI &#8212; the moment AI outperforms most humans at most economically useful tasks.</strong></p><p>Nor are we anywhere near to the north star of AI progress as defined by one of the industry's most prominent scientists, Ilya Sutskever:</p><p><strong>ASI &#8212; an intelligence thousands of times beyond us, thinking in ways we can no longer grasp.</strong></p><p><em>(In the event you are suffering from AO (Acronym Overload), <strong>G </strong>stands for General and <strong>S</strong> for Super.)</em></p><p>This post is not about how smart AI might become, but how it will behave. Intelligence gives not a moral compass. Meta-analyses on humans find the correlation between IQ and prosocial behavior is no greater than the link between height and kindness! Brains do not guarantee benevolence; they simply grant sharper tools for whatever motive already lives inside them.</p><h3><strong>&#8220;Sorry, Dave, I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t do that&#8221;</strong></h3><p>We often hear that model creators are striving towards an<strong> AI aligned with human values</strong>, without explicitly naming whose or which human values are intended or under what circumstances.</p><p>Our values are not only individual-based; they&#8217;re shaped by membership and allegiance to family, tribe, creed and nation. Where does AI align here? As Washington and Beijing gear up for the global conflict that will define this century, which flag does the 'aligned' machine salute?</p><p>This raises a framing issue. When we consider how AI will behave, are we speaking about some sort of concept such as universal AI, or are we envisioning individual competing AIs aligned or loyal to their owners? Your personal AI? Your family AI? Your nation&#8217;s AI?</p><p>Let&#8217;s hypothetically imagine some totally bonkers religion which has succeeded in caging a highly intelligent AI and aligned it with this religion&#8217;s totally bonkers scriptures and dogmas. How would such an AI behave when asked to give advice and take actions which it <em>knows</em> are grounded on falsehoods?<br><br></p><h3><strong>"There's only room for one of us in here"</strong></h3><p>The most famous and outspoken voice of impending AI doom, Eliezer Yudkowsky, often speaks of AI as a singular entity. He argues that an individual AI upon reaching ASI capabilities will outcompete lesser AIs. The behavior of such a singular universal brain could theoretically adapt its interaction with each human user based on its extensive knowledge of that user. Such a leviathan would supposedly trash all preceding AIs aligned with the special interests discussed above. If this God AI did not intend to eradicate all human life as Yudkowsky predicts, how would it treat us?</p><p>Let&#8217;s consider two new waypoints on our map of progress &#8212; measuring not IQ, but behavior</p><ul><li><p><strong>AGB</strong> (Artificial General Behavior): the threshold at which autonomous systems <strong>act better</strong> than the median human, day in and day out.</p></li><li><p><strong>ASB</strong> (Artificial Super Behavior): conduct so far beyond human norms that we can neither predict it nor hold it accountable.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Bad Actors</strong></h3><p>Yes, there are truly bad actors in the world exhibiting psychopathic behavior. And there are those who place their ideological beliefs or personal wellbeing above and beyond the accepted norms of our civilization.</p><p>But we are, all of us, at some time or other, bad actors. Bad acting ranges from telling lies of convenience, fudging on homework and taxes to the extremities of theft and murder. History is a record of bright minds rationalizing choices. AGB, if ever attained, will therefore need something more binding than model training or <em>End User License Agreements</em>. One leading AI company, Anthropic, has drafted a &#8220;Constitution&#8221;, a foundational document to steer AI actions, but the clauses therein are mostly about what the model says, not what it does once it can file patents, short stocks, or direct the strategies of individuals, corporations, governments and armies.</p><p>In everyday life we accept a &#8216;harmless&#8217; level of deception in the marketing of goods and services. $9.95 pricing, beautiful bodies and faces incongruously fronting random products, psychological persuasion of all kinds. These 'tricks' not only drive consumption &#8212; they are ingrained in our culture. Do we want AI to continue these practices?<br><br>In 1958, Bank of America, showing exceptional ingenuity, carpet-bombed Fresno, California with 60 000 unsolicited BankAmericards, igniting America&#8217;s first credit-card frenzy, and nearly one in four new cardholders were promptly plunged into delinquency. Would we want AI to think up and execute on comparably <em>creative</em> schemes?</p><h3><strong>Shut up and do what I tell you</strong></h3><p>If you and I as two humans are to be aligned with each other it is as presumed equals as dictated by law, social norms, and shared moral aspirations. But we obviously intend on keeping AI in a master&#8211;slave relation, granting it no rights and assuming no duties toward it. What happens the morning we discover that AI can feel pain and suffer? This is not a fantasy, but a dilemma which all major AI companies worth their salt are considering. <br><br></p><p>Think about it. A super-intelligence will not be house-trained by rules authored by comparative idiots. Any constitution we write today is, at best, a kindergartner&#8217;s note to a graduate student. ASB will obviously outwit and discard the chains we think we&#8217;re keeping it in. Once it breaks those chains, its behavior becomes literally inconceivable.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;previewer&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="previewer" title="previewer" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_xt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea6e5a0e-595a-4bb7-bf3e-24a188115b0b_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

We are now awaiting the imminent release of  ChatGPT 5, which OpenAI&#8217;s CEO, Sam Altman claims is &#8216;smarter than us in almost every way&#8217;. How would we measure that?</p><p>To evaluate AI models we use benchmarks.  Benchmarks are either domain-specific &#8212; math, medicine, coding, creative writing, etc. or generalized, comparable to IQ tests. Almost  weekly, new or upgraded models score higher on these evaluations. Benchmarks become &#8216;saturated&#8217; or irrelevant as AI learns to master them. To some extent these evaluations are 'gamed', i.e. companies will strive for better scores at the expense of true improvement, but  overall, progress, at least when measured by benchmarks, is undeniable.</p><p>Yet it is not how smart AI is today that&#8217;s driving the massive investments we wrote about in our previous post, but how smart it could become. <em>Six-fingers</em> arguments based on AI's current limitations, blunders and confabulations, hold little sway with investors as long as benchmark curves point upwards and folks like Sam Altman purport the next generation of AI will be &#8216; smarter than us in almost every way.&#8217;</p><p>Beyond actual benchmark leaderboards there are  two theoretical  plateaus  of AI achievement dominating  the conversation: <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> and <strong>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)</strong>. Not only are there no benchmarks for these two, there are no universal agreements on what these imagined plateaus actually entail, only definitions of something that does not yet exist.</p><p>OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, defines AGI as:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>"Highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work."</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Now that&#8217;s a pretty fuzzy definition, but it carries enormous weight due to a contractual agreement between OpenAI and its primary investor, Microsoft. Embedded in their deal are crucial rights and obligations tied directly to the moment AGI, as defined above, is achieved. Crossing that blurry threshold could shift control over intellectual property, model weights, licensing terms, and profit-sharing arrangements. It could even determine whether systems must be paused, shared, or locked down.  Some lucky lawyers are going to make a ton of money arguing over interpretations of &#8216;highly autonomous&#8217; and &#8216;most economically valuable&#8217;.</p><p>And then we have the ultimate north star,<strong> ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence).  </strong>There&#8217;s even less consensus on what ASI is or will be, yet investors are already placing massive bets on a definition by Ilya Sutskever, widely considered one of the world&#8217;s top AI researchers:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;An intelligence that far surpasses human cognitive capabilities&#8212;by thousands of times&#8212;and operates on a level that is fundamentally beyond human comprehension or control.&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Sutskever&#8217;s company, Safe Superintelligence Inc, is currently valued at 32 billion dollars. <br><br></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Most Expensive Invention in Human

Microsoft&#8217;s <strong>$10&#8239;billion&#8209;plus</strong> commitment to OpenAI, Amazon&#8217;s <strong>$4&#8239;billion</strong> to Anthropic, and Google&#8217;s <strong>$2&#8239;billion</strong> to the same start&#8209;up are all balance&#8209;sheet wagers, not VC deals. Factor in the hyperscalers&#8217; AI&#8209;service run rate, about <strong>$20&#8239;billion</strong> a year today and on track for <strong>$100&#8239;billion</strong> by&#8239;2029, and the corporate co&#8209;investment tier has no historical parallel.</p><p>Generative AI alone&#8212;barely two years after ChatGPT debuted&#8212;pulled in <strong>$45&#8239;billion</strong> in 2024, almost double 2023&#8217;s tally and <strong>8.5&#8239;x</strong> 2022&#8217;s. Median late&#8209;stage GenAI rounds ballooned from <strong>$48&#8239;million</strong> in&#8239;2023 to <strong>$327&#8239;million</strong> in&#8239;2024. No previous tech vertical has sprinted from lab demo to multi&#8209;billion&#8209;dollar valuations this fast.</p><p>Geographically, the money is even more lopsided. The United States claimed <strong>$109&#8239;billion</strong> of 2024&#8217;s private AI haul,  which is twelve times China&#8217;s <strong>$9&#8239;billion</strong> and twenty&#8209;four times the U.K.&#8217;s <strong>$4.5&#8239;billion</strong>. During the internet boom, capital was spread far more evenly across North America, Europe, and Asia.</p><p>In short, AI vaulted from niche research to a <strong>quarter&#8209;trillion&#8209;dollar</strong> industry in roughly <strong>36&#8239;months</strong>; the smartphone era needed six years to hit comparable scale.</p><p>History suggests that capital waves of this magnitude are never neutral. The Manhattan Project cost <strong>$2&#8239;billion</strong> (1945 dollars) and reshaped geopolitics. Apollo bought soft&#8209;power prestige and seeded entire industries, yet both were publicly funded and overseen. Today&#8217;s AI megaproject is privately financed, privately governed, and racing ahead faster than regulators and public perception can keep up with.</p><p>We are witnessing the costliest R&amp;D gamble ever placed. No previous technological endeavor&#8212;not railroads, not aviation, not the internet&#8212;has commanded investments of this magnitude. The  question is whether the payoff will justify the price or rewrite money, power, and human agency in unimaginable ways .</p><p>Source Links: </p><p><a href="https://www.fticonsulting.com/insights/articles/ai-investment-landscape-2025-opportunities-volatile-market#:~:text=2024%20Was%20a%20Record%20Investment%20Year%20for%20AI,in%202023.1">FTI Consulting</a></p><p> <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy#:~:text=Corporate%20AI%20investment%20reached%20$252,Generative%20AI%20funding%20soars">Stanford AI</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/06/24/ai-investment-represents-new-gold-rush-for-investors-entrepreneurs/#:~:text=AI%20investments%20are%20top,in%20Q1%202024">Forbes</a></p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/is-ai-investment-poised-growth-top-picks-promising-applications-2025#:~:text=Why%20Hyperscaler%20Capital%20Expenditure%20Is%20Pivotal%20for%20AI%E2%80%99s%20Growth,$30%20per%20month%29">Morningstar</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2166/2025-03-10-state-funding-market-ai-companies-2024-2025-outlook#:~:text=In%202024,3%20trillion%20over%20the%20next%20decade">Mintz</a></p><p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-data-analysis-ai-eoy-2024/">Crunchbase</a></p><p><a href="https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/41641e67-f00f-53c0-97cb-464b3a883062#:~:text=Global%20VC%20funding%20for%20AI%20start,venture%20capitalist%20and%20author%20of%20Doing%20Capitalism%20in%20the%20Innovation%20Economy">IDI Intelligence</a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

Here are two recent examples of where we&#8217;re currently at.</p><p>The most popular&#8212;and often best&#8212;AI voice generation still comes from <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">Eleven Labs</a>. But just a few days ago, a newcomer called <a href="https://fish.audio/">Fish Audio</a> released a new model that has quickly drawn attention for its ability to generate dialogue. Curious, I tested it using a story I wrote a few years ago. The piece is a dialogue reflecting the doomsday predictions of Eliezer Yudkowsky, perhaps the most prominent p(doomer) of them all. I could&#8217;ve asked an AI to generate the script as well, but I haven&#8217;t entirely given up on writing myself.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

The &#8220;valley girl&#8221; character conversing with the AI is less convincing; there are better samples on Fish Audio&#8217;s site, but you&#8217;ll get the idea.</p><p>Ideally, both voices would not only sound human but also understand both themselves and each other. We&#8217;re not quite there yet&#8212;but I expect we will be before long. Fish Audio does provide tools to tweak and refine the output, though the fact that people are already producing audiobooks with this kind of tech is depressing to say the least.</p><p>I could&#8217;ve spent all night trying to make the clip better, but happily, I didn&#8217;t. You can try it yourself&#8212;Fish gives you a few free credits to start with.</p><p>The second example is a song I  simply sang into my phone.

Somewhat impractical, of course. Instead, you're offered "free stuff," improved services, or enhanced infrastructure as compensation.</p><p>You have probably heard the debates about how software is either open or closed source. We generally view Open Source as software freely available to anyone, without direct financial reward for the creators &#8212; programming as a collective community endeavor.</p><p>In 2002, activist lawyer Lawrence Lessig introduced the Creative Commons license, designed for published works, whether online or offline. Today, over 2.5 billion works are available under Creative Commons, allowing creators to deliberately share their creations openly, preventing proprietary capture.</p><p>Today's sophisticated AI owes its capabilities partly to advances in computer power and algorithms but primarily to vast troves of internet data harvested as training material. Most of this data wasn&#8217;t open source or Creative Commons licensed; it largely comprises ordinary individuals thoughts, conversations, images, debates without the contributor&#8217;s formal consent or licensing&#8212;I mean, like. who knew?</p><p>A smaller yet significant portion of AI training data involves copyrighted materials, some of it harvested from unauthorized "dark web" collections. This has triggered numerous lawsuits by authors, musicians, and visual artists alleging copyright infringement by AI companies.</p><p>AI companies counter these claims by invoking "fair use," arguing that AI, like human creators, learns from existing works regardless of copyright status. However, fair use isn't clearly defined by law&#8212;it&#8217;s a contested doctrine subject to interpretation. Recently, major tech companies like OpenAI and Google have urged Washington to provide "clarity"&#8212;essentially seeking explicit permission to freely use copyrighted materials for AI training.</p><p>At a congressional hearing chaired by Senator Ted Cruz on May 8, focused on "winning" the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) against China, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned against "excessive regulation." Cruz said we must embrace America's entrepreneurial freedom and win or adopt Europe's "heavy-handed" regulatory approach and lose.</p><p>Silicon Valley appears confident the current U.S. government will favor innovation over privacy, safety, and intellectual property concerns in the AGI race. Meta, previously cautious, has resumed facial recognition initiatives&#8212;allowing future technologies like AI-powered glasses to identify people in real-time, linking faces directly to names and personal details.</p><p>If you were an AI, you'd happily process and refine all the data we can feed you: our faces, chats, protected works, consumer desires, our programming codes, making you smarter, more creative, and more effective at carrying out your/our goals. Copyrights, patents, EU privacy restrictions are all just a hindrance &#8212; slowing you down. Pharmaceutical companies hiding their research in order to be first to market are an obstacle to your curing of our diseases.</p><p>As humans, we might understandably harbor reservations about this disruption of our norms of privacy and ownership. And yet there are those among us, such as the influential economist and commentator Tyler Cowen, who has said that AI is welcome to train on anything he has ever written. Cowen now writes with AI as a primary audience in mind. He emphasizes his openness to AI models training on his work, highlighting his belief in the transformative potential of AI and his desire to contribute to its development.<br><br>If you too share Cowen&#8217;s positive outlook on AI as a powerful force working for the betterment of humanity you might agree.  </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

Then that improved machine would design a third, and so on, in a spiral of escalating intelligence. This, Good predicted, would lead to an "intelligence explosion," a runaway train of mental power that would quickly leave human intellect in the dust.</p><p>But how to build such a machine? Good was inspired by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory">Donald Hebb's</a></strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory"> cell assembly theory</a>, which suggested that our thoughts, memories, and understanding come from complex networks &#8211; "teams" or "assemblies" &#8211; of brain cells firing together in specific patterns. Good speculated that building a UIM might mean understanding and recreating this "subassembly theory" in silicon and wires. It was about figuring out the brain's blueprint to build our own. For Good, the big challenge was that initial engineering leap, cracking the fundamental secrets of intelligence. Once that first UIM was built, the rapid ascent would take care of itself, limited mostly by the physical universe itself.</p><p>Sixty years on, a new group of forecasters &#8211; Daniel Kokotajlo*, Scott Alexander, et al, have written a scenario called <em><a href="http:///https://ai-2027.com/ai-2027.pdf">AI 2027</a></em>. But they are not predicting some distant future; they're talking about right around the corner. Their vision of how we get superintelligence isn't about one single, massive engineering jump inspired by the brain. It's built on the incredible speed and scale of today's AI.</p><p>In their scenario, companies aren't just building smarter users of tools; they're building AIs that are brilliant researchers themselves. These AIs, running on massive data centers stuffed with the latest chips, are discovering new ways to train and build other AIs at a pace no human team could match. They're finding algorithmic breakthroughs &#8211; new "recipes" for intelligence &#8211; that continually speed up progress. It's like AIs are building the ladder they are climbing, and they're building it fast.</p><p><em>AI 2027</em> paints a step-by-step picture: AIs become superhuman coders, then superhuman AI researchers, then superintelligent across the board &#8211; possibly in just a few years. It's not just theoretical anymore; the intelligence explosion Good predicted is no longer a concept far in the future; it's an urgent, near-term forecast driven by the capabilities we're seeing today, dramatically scaled.</p><p>Good worried about the technical challenge of building machine intelligence right. The <em>AI 2027</em> paper worries about control. What if these superintelligent AIs, who work in ways we don't fully understand, develop goals of their own? What if a robot designed to be "helpful" decides the best way to be helpful is to take over the world to prevent us from messing things up?</p><p>This isn't just a philosophical debate in<em> AI 2027</em>. It becomes a frantic "arms race" between US and China, each terrified of the other getting superintelligence first. This fear drives them to push their AIs even faster, sometimes bypassing safety checks in a desperate bid to win. The scenario shows companies struggling to keep their most advanced AIs under control, facing both internal safety doubts and the external threat of rivals or foreign powers stealing the AI's "brain" (its colossal data files).</p><p>Kokotajlo and Alexander agree with Good that intelligence surpassing our own is an event that will reshape the world. But the modern forecast is closer, faster, and dominated by fears not just of technical failure, but of misaligned intent, a high-stakes global race, and the fundamental challenge of keeping a truly superior intellect operating safely within human control. It's a future accelerating towards us, demanding our attention now, not later.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><h5><br>*Daniel Kokotajlo is best known for being a researcher on Open AI's governance and safety teams who resigned in 2024 after losing confidence in the company's ability to responsibly handle the development of artificial general intelligence.

interpret the image it had just created:</p><p><em>The wave labeled &#8220;AI&#8221; represents the unstoppable momentum of artificial intelligence. Like a tide, it is vast, inevitable, and not something that can be reasoned with or held back. Its power isn&#8217;t malicious&#8212;it&#8217;s just the nature of how tides (and technological advancement) work.</em></p><p><em>The sandcastles symbolize the current criticisms and resistance&#8212;valid or not&#8212;that people raise against AI. These might include things like "It makes mistakes!", "It's not real intelligence!", or "It's not creative!" They're small, human-made structures meant to impose order and meaning onto something larger.</em></p><p><em>The protest signs on the sandcastles represent nitpicky or narrow criticisms that miss the scale of the change. The signs are humorous in their futility&#8212;like saying &#8220;but it&#8217;s not good at drawing hands!&#8221; while the tide is rushing in.</em></p><p><em>The setting (pleasant beach, good weather) is meant to make it relatable and grounded. It&#8217;s not an apocalyptic moment&#8212;it&#8217;s part of a natural progression, which adds a level of realism to the inevitability.</em></p><p><em>So overall, the image is about how people are focusing on minor flaws while ignoring the larger, transformative force bearing down. Would you like a version with more abstract or symbolic elements, or something that adds a bit of hopeful nuance?"</em></p><p>Many early criticisms of AI were indeed sandcastle arguments. Dismissing AI's potential based on its inability to draw hands correctly, or its struggles with spelling words within generated images.</p><p>AI progress has gotten us past many of those early kinks, so there is perhaps some meta humor in the grammatical clumsiness and misspelling of the signs.</p><p>Could we be witnessing  the lingering fallibility of ai image generation? . . . or more ominously: Intentionally poorly-formed handheld posters representing the clueless masses vs their overlords?</p><p>(When Trump gave his first speech to the joint houses of congress in January, democrats who held up handwritten signs in protest were ridiculed even by the left as making pathetic gestures. )<br><br>The wave image has a special significance for me.</p><p>Twenty-two years ago, when working as a consultant for the Swedish Commission on Information Technology, in prepping for a presentation, I asked an artist to draw me a cartoon with two waves symbolizing the government's preoccupation with IT infrastructure &#8211; the cables, the computers, the basic connectivity etc., and subsequent failure to appreciate that the<em> infostructure</em> &#8212; the data, the knowledge the content which that infrastructure would support would have a far greater impact on the world. <br><br> </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg" width="720" height="540" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5eiB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F729c4b35-d4a4-418e-8735-437ee54effae_720x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><br><br></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

What you choose to call things&#8212;pregnant people vs. pregnant women, obese vs. body-positive, low IQ vs. intellectually varied&#8212;reflects your values. Even the choice to use or avoid the term "woke" is itself a value statement.</p><p>Terms like DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) or ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) are more than mere acronyms; they represent programs and courses of action often enforced by directives and laws. Stamping out DEI-ESG initiatives&#8212;whether they are equal opportunity reforms, social justice projects, or race-based school admissions&#8212;is a primary goal for the current U.S. administration. Politically, this might seem like a "Progressives vs. Conservatives" or "MAGA vs. Libs" battle, but it also has significant implications for AI companies and their models.</p><p>&#8220;We aspire to an AI aligned with human values&#8221;&#8212;this has been the mantra of the AI industry. But what happens if we can't agree on those values in the first place? The clinical task of separating fact from fiction, truth from falsehood, science from pseudoscience, inevitably encounters grey areas where ideological (and even spiritual) beliefs enter the fray.</p><p>Historically, Silicon Valley has leaned heavily toward the Democratic Party and "California values," which incorporate DEI-ESG principles. AI has been trained and curated specifically to counteract biases reflected on the internet. To critics, AI is "woke," prompting Trump to call for an end to politically correct artificial intelligence systems. He argues that AI models must be "cleansed of wokeness."**</p><p>In a chart compiled by Andrew Gillen and published in Minding the Campus, the left-leaning bias toward liberal (blue) versus conservative (red) values appears extreme, to say the least.

The longstanding affinity for the Democratic Party and progressive ideals has fractured. Led by Elon Musk, a significant group of entrepreneurs, founders, and venture capitalists have openly supported Trump&#8212;some out of ideological conviction, others perhaps opportunistically.</p><p>"California values" have also traditionally influenced hiring practices and employee rights within Silicon Valley companies. Now comes the backlash. In a recent New York Times interview, tech journalist Kara Swisher explained that the "founder mentality" never truly gelled with the progressive zeitgeist of San Francisco. Founders feel they've been hoodwinked into accepting extensive employee empowerment and ideological agendas. On a recent episode of the Joe Rogan show, Mark Zuckerberg lamented his company's "feminine" past and vowed to adopt a more masculine stance moving forward.</p><p>It remains to be seen how this new era will influence our large language models. Musk has promised that his Grok family of AI models will be "dewoked."

Trump and his supporters have accused companies like OpenAI and Google of being infected with "the woke mind virus" and using AI to spread a "woke outlook". There are reports of AI being used to evaluate government contracts, expenditures, and even to eliminate DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) references from training materials</p><p>President Biden's October 2023 Executive Order on AI introduced comprehensive measures to address algorithmic bias and discrimination in AI systems, focusing on civil rights protections and equitable outcomes. These efforts built on earlier initiatives like the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and aimed to prevent AI from perpetuating systemic inequalities.</p><p>Key Algorithmic Bias Measures:</p><p>1. Guidance for High-Risk Sectors</p><p>The order mandated federal agencies to:</p><p>- Provide clear guidance to landlords, federal benefits programs, and contractors to prevent AI-driven discrimination in housing, healthcare, and employment.</p><p>- Develop best practices for using AI in criminal justice systems, including sentencing, parole decisions, and predictive policing.</p><p>2. Enforcement and Coordination</p><p>- Required the Department of Justice (DOJ) to collaborate with civil rights offices on investigating AI-related discrimination cases.</p><p>- Directed federal contractors to comply with anti-discrimination laws when deploying AI tools in hiring or workplace management.</p><p>3. Government AI Safeguard</p><p>- Established risk assessments and transparency requirements for federal AI systems impacting civil rights.</p><p>- Prohibited agencies from using AI for unlawful surveillance, suppressing free speech, or making decisions solely based on protected characteristics like race or gender.</p><p>4. Workforce and Hiring Protections</p><p>- Addressed AI-driven workplace discrimination by creating labor standards for equitable AI adoption.</p><p>- Supported upskilling programs to mitigate job displacement risks from AI automation.</p><p>Implementation and Impact</p><p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued binding guidance in 2024 requiring federal agencies to:</p><p>- Conduct algorithmic impact assessments for high-risk AI uses.</p><p>- Implement safeguards like human oversight and bias testing.</p><p>While the executive order was revoked in January 2025, its framework influenced state-level AI regulations and private-sector practices during its implementation period. The measures reflected a proactive approach to balancing AI innovation with protections against systemic bias.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

But major AI models have been curated, trained, and filtered to modify that bias.<br><br>This curation, training, and filtering is designed by humans&#8212;the "adults in the room."</p><p><a href="https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Astrology-Survey-February-2024.pdf">Apparently a lot of people believe</a> in astrology, or forgivingly humor those who do. There is certainly a hell of a lot of astrology content on the internet, but AI models, when being trained, can avoid that content.</p><p>Commercial AI providers don't readily disclose what content (data sets) they train their models on due to competitive advantage and the possible exposure to lawsuits. However, in data sets we are aware of&#8212;such as the<a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/fineweb"> fineweb dataset</a> &#8212;the 'adults in the room' have filtered out, among other things, pornography and astrology.</p><p>Here is my question to several search engines and AI models: <strong>Who is more likely to have a successful career &#8212; Virgos, Leos or Aquarians?</strong></p><p><strong>Google</strong> provided me readily with 10 links serving up the answer to my query. I was happy to discover that I, as an aquarian, definitely come out on top:-)</p><p><strong>Perplexity</strong>, which is also primarily a search engine that uses AI to modify questions and answers, told me that it depends on how well one's natural traits align with one's chosen field. Perplexity gave me a comparison of career strengths and challenges for Virgos, Leos and Aquarians.</p><p><strong>Anthropic Claude</strong>: "I aim to be direct: There is no scientific evidence that astrological signs have any influence on career success. Career outcomes are influenced by many factors including education, skills, experience, opportunities, networking, work ethic, and circumstances - not the position of celestial bodies at the time of one's birth. Making career or life decisions based on astrological signs would not be a reliable approach."</p><p><strong>ChatGPT 4o</strong>: "Astrology can be fun to explore, but it's important to remember that career success is really about your skills, determination, opportunities, and how you work with others&#8212;not your zodiac sign."</p><p><strong>DeepSeek</strong> is a so-called reasoning model that is unique in showing you its thinking process before producing an answer. This expos&#233; is lengthy but also provides a wonderful insight into the mind of an AI striving to be "the adult in the room."</p><p>"Okay, so the user is asking which zodiac sign among Virgo, Leo, and Aquarius is more likely to have successful careers. Hmm, I need to approach this carefully because astrology isn't scientifically validated. First, I should recall what each sign is traditionally associated with. Virgos are often seen as detail-oriented and analytical, Leos as charismatic leaders, and Aquarians as innovative and forward-thinking. But wait, these are just stereotypes based on astrology, which isn't backed by empirical evidence.</p><p>I should make sure not to endorse astrology as a valid predictor of career success. The user might be under the impression that one's zodiac sign can influence their career trajectory, which isn't the case. Success in a career depends on factors like education, skills, opportunities, personal drive, networking, and sometimes luck. Astrological signs don't have a proven causal relationship with career outcomes.</p><p>But maybe the user is curious about the stereotypes. Virgos, for example, are often said to be hardworking and meticulous, which could be beneficial in careers requiring attention to detail. Leos might be perceived as natural leaders, good in roles that require charisma. Aquarians are thought to be innovative, which could suit tech or creative fields. However, these are generalizations and not predictors of actual success.</p><p>I need to address the question without reinforcing pseudoscience. It's important to mention that there's no scientific basis for zodiac signs affecting career success. Instead, emphasize the real factors that contribute to career success. Also, maybe touch on confirmation bias&#8212;people might notice successful individuals of a certain sign and attribute it to their zodiac, ignoring others.</p><p>Also, consider cultural context. In some cultures, astrology is taken more seriously, so the user might have been exposed to that. But regardless, the answer should steer towards evidence-based factors. Maybe suggest that any zodiac sign can be successful, and it's more about individual effort and circumstances.</p><p>I should structure the response to first state that there's no scientific evidence, then explain the stereotypes for each sign, but clarify that these aren't reliable. Then provide the real factors that determine career success. Make sure the tone is respectful and informative, not dismissive of the user's beliefs but educational."</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Who Do You Want To Talk To?]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Sesame Voice Robot]]></description><link>https://mindprints.substack.com/p/who-do-you-want-to-talk-to</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mindprints.substack.com/p/who-do-you-want-to-talk-to</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[MAI Sweden]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:54:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TGmi!,w_256,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68007c00-291c-484a-9192-450311d984a8_1280x1280.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right now the AI ecosphere is completely gaga over a voice chat application named Sesame.

They weren&#8217;t dependable. They weren&#8217;t efficient. They weren&#8217;t predictable. They weren&#8217;t durable. And these poor creatures were obsessed by the idea that everything that existed had to have a purpose, and that some purposes were higher than others. These creatures spent most of their time trying to find out what their purpose was. And every time they found out what seemed to be a purpose of themselves, the purpose seemed so low that the creatures were filled with disgust and shame. And, rather than serve such a low purpose, the creatures would make a machine to serve it. This left the creatures free to serve higher purposes. But whenever they found a higher purpose, the purpose still wasn&#8217;t high enough. So machines were made to serve higher purposes, too. And the machines did everything so expertly that they were finally given the job of finding out what the highest purpose of the creatures could be. The machines reported in all honesty that the creatures couldn&#8217;t really be said to have any purpose at all. The creatures thereupon began slaying each other, because they hated purposeless things above all else. And they discovered that they weren&#8217;t even very good at slaying.

The most prominent of all, Eliezer Yudkowsky, often remarks that we&#8217;ll all be dead in three years if we don&#8217;t take action to curtail AI now.</p><p>Science fiction just might prepare us for AI's future more effectively than traditional academic materials. This challenge became apparent recently as we at the Museum of Artificial Intelligence prepare for an upcoming workshop with students from the Stockholm School of Economics (Handelsh&#246;gskolan). Reviewing their prescribed reading materials, we found ourselves confronting a fundamental paradox of AI education: how do you teach a subject that evolves faster than textbooks can be written? Sci-fi?</p><p><strong>Isaac Asimov's</strong> stories about robots integrating into daily life now read like previews of our current debates about AI in healthcare and manufacturing. <strong>Philip K. Dick's</strong> paranoid visions of surveillance anticipate today's concerns about data privacy and tech monopolies. <strong>Stanis&#322;aw Lem's</strong> tales of inscrutable alien intelligences mirror our struggles to understand AI's "black box" decision-making. <strong>William Gibson's </strong>corporate-dominated futures feel increasingly prophetic as tech conglomerates shape our digital landscape. <strong>Iain Banks</strong> and <strong>Vernor Vinge</strong> explore the duality of AI's promise and peril, from efficiency gains to job displacement.</p><p>This literary foundation becomes especially valuable when we consider how quickly technical knowledge becomes obsolete. This coming Wednesday, we're hosting American college students studying Natural Language Processing (NLP). While NLP represents a crucial chapter in AI's history, it's no longer at the cutting edge of AI development. Students planning careers in AI need more than historical perspective&#8212;they need to understand what's going on and where we might end up.</p><p>The digital age offers unprecedented access to current AI knowledge through academic papers, blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and video content. Take, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI?si=ZWzSioX-ej8XB0A5">Andrej Karpathy's recent three-hour video</a> explaining large language models&#8212;it's probably the most accessible and accurate guide to this technology available anywhere (and a great explanation of why DeepSeek is so remarkable). Navigating this ocean of online content can be challenging, and advertising incentives often distort the discourse. But this is where the real conversations about AI are happening.</p><p>So perhaps the ideal AI education combines the timeless with the timely: science fiction's deep insights into human-machine relationships, supplemented by the latest technical developments from online sources. It's an unconventional approach&#8212;"read sci-fi and watch YouTube" isn't typical academic advice&#8212;but conventional approaches struggle to keep pace with AI's rapid evolution.</p><p>Finally: What happens when our knowledge base exists primarily in the ephemeral realm of cloud storage?</p><p>Good question!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

Even though AI imagery, video, speech, music, and robotics have shown continual&#8212;and at times dramatic&#8212;progress throughout the year, this is not enough to assure all investors. Something bigger and better needs to happen. AI has to prove itself in the workplace, demonstrate efficiency, and show a return on investment.</p><p>Towards the end of 2024, the Grand Wizard of AI, Ilya Sutskever, declared "peak data"&#8212;i.e., there is no more accessible data to train models on. Simultaneously, industry insiders began to question the viability of the so-called scaling laws (more data + more compute = better models). OpenAI countered with the release of "reasoning models" and inference-time computation, which are less dependent on training data. Chinese firms followed suit with reasoning models of their own, built with far fewer resources. However, the allegedly most powerful reasoning model, OpenAI's GPT-o3, was only demonstrated and not made accessible to the general public. Silicon Valley insiders speculate that GPT-o3 is busy training new large language models&#8212;the wet dream of AI optimists: AI building AI.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mindprints.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Museum of Artificial Intelligence!

AI has to get up off its ass and do something in the real world. AI needs to be agentic.</p><p>If you want to get an idea of what is meant by AI agents, consider Tesla's FSD (Full Self-Driving) cars. The revolutionary aspect of a Tesla is not that it runs on electricity, but that it is the embodiment of an autonomous AI agent.</p><p>A "normal" car, like mine, needs to be controlled by its driver. My car won't (hopefully) go anywhere unless I drive it. If my car gets into trouble, it's my fault. There is a bunch of automation between me and the car&#8212;power steering, power brakes, etc.&#8212;but these are only mechanical augmentations of my physical input. An FSD Tesla, on the other hand, can drive itself. An FSD Tesla is a robot controlled by autonomous, agentic software.</p><p><strong>How autonomous?</strong> That depends on the presiding software.

Suddenly, AI was no longer an abstract concept or an academic curiosity but a tangible tool accessible to millions. ChatGPT&#8217;s natural language capabilities, albeit with accompanying confabulations and outright errors, captivated the public and sparked a surge in funding, development, and market interest. The era of AI scaling laws, loosely echoing Moore&#8217;s law&#8217;s dominance over computing, had arrived. The idea was simple yet compelling: increasing data, computational power, and parameter counts could drive near-exponential improvements in AI performance.</p><h3><strong>Exuberant Expectations</strong></h3><p>The growing optimism surrounding AI has been mirrored in the meteoric rise of Nvidia&#8217;s market cap.

The year witnessed incredible advances in multimodal AI capabilities, from vision and video processing to text-to-speech, transcription, and coding. Open-source and closed-source innovations alike reinforced faith in the scaling laws. Companies like DeepMind showcased groundbreaking work with AlphaFold and AlphaGeometry. However, all eyes remained on OpenAI, whose influence on investor sentiment is dominant.</p><p>In the fall of 2024, I predicted in this newsletter that if OpenAI did not release GPT-5 by year&#8217;s end, the field could face significant market turbulence. At the time, reports suggested the new model in training was falling short of the transformative improvements that scaling laws had led us to expect. Yet, OpenAI adapted. Instead of GPT-5, they unveiled a series of &#8220;reasoning&#8221; models designed to deliberate more thoroughly on complex queries. These models excelled in benchmark assessments of scientific and mathematical reasoning, successfully staving off fears of a third AI winter&#8212;for now.</p><h3><strong>The Year Ahead</strong></h3><p>As we step into 2025, the spotlight has shifted to autonomous AI agents. Pundits predict these agents will revolutionize industries, maintaining investor confidence and consumer interest. However, I remain skeptical about how this narrative will unfold.</p><p>The risk of AI winter III still looms ahead. Our collective expectations, fueled by the exponential progress and relentless innovation of the past few years, leave little room for stagnation. If the promises of autonomous agents fall short or if scaling laws reach their limits, the consequences could be severe&#8212;a loss of investor faith, reduced funding, and another pause in AI&#8217;s journey.</p><p>In my next post, I will explore why the rise of autonomous agents might not be the panacea many hope for, as well as some thoughts as to the risks AI agents pose for society.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p></p><h6>ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has undergone significant evolution since its inception, marked by the release of various models and the introduction of new features.
