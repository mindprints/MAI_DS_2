## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Relative Path Problems on Subpages

#### Symptoms:
```
"GET /sv/assets/css/tailwind.css?v=2" Error (404)
"GET /pages/assets/css/styles.css?v=2" Error (404)
```

#### Root Cause:
HTML files in subdirectories (`sv/`, `pages/`) are using incorrect relative paths.

#### Current (Wrong):
```html
<!-- In src/site/sv/index.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/tailwind.css">
<!-- Resolves to: /sv/assets/css/tailwind.css ‚ùå -->
```

#### Should Be:
```html
<!-- In src/site/sv/index.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/tailwind.css">
<!-- Resolves to: /assets/css/tailwind.css ‚úÖ -->
```

### Issue 2: Strange `/index.html/` Prefix

#### Symptoms:
```
"GET /index.html/admin" Error (404)
"GET /index.html/assets/css/tailwind.css" Error (404)
"GET /index.html/images/evolution-AI.avif" Error (404)
```

#### Root Cause:
A page is treating `/index.html` as a directory, likely due to:
- Incorrect base URL configuration
- Wrong href in navigation links
- Or a link like `<a href="index.html/admin">` instead of `<a href="/admin">`

---

### Issue 3: Missing Favicon

#### Symptoms:
```
"GET /favicon.ico" Error (404)
```

#### Root Cause:
No favicon.ico in the root of `public/` directory.
