                    <p class="text-slate-400">
                        Artificial Intelligence did not begin with computers but with human imagination. Philosophers
                        from Aristotle to Descartes speculated about logic, reasoning, and mechanical minds long before machines existed to
                        test these ideas. In the 20th century, Alan Turing proposed the idea of a "universal machine" and the famous Turing
                        Test, laying the groundwork for a science that would seek to recreate human thought.
                    
                        The 1956 Dartmouth Conference is often called the birth of AI as a research field. Early pioneers such as John
                        McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert Simon explored symbolic reasoning, problem solving, and machine learning. Over
                        the decades, AI has experienced cycles of great optimism and "AI winters," when progress slowed due to limited
                        computing power or overly ambitious expectations.
                    
                        Today, AI has grown into a global enterprise driving fields from medicine to art. Machine learning, neural networks,
                        and large-scale data have made systems like ChatGPT, self-driving cars, and image generators possible. What began as
                        a philosophical question—can machines think?—has become a practical force shaping science, culture, and society.

                    <p class="text-slate-400">
                        Our workshops are designed to move beyond theory and into practice. You will learn how to work directly with today's
                        most powerful AI tools, gaining practical skills that can be applied in your studies, projects, and workplace. No
                        advanced technical background is required—just curiosity and a willingness to experiment.
                    
                        Participants will explore applications ranging from text generation and image creation to data analysis and decision
                        support. You'll learn how to frame the right questions, guide AI outputs, and critically assess results. We
                        emphasize both creativity and problem-solving, showing how AI can assist in tasks from brainstorming to technical
                        research.
                    
                        By the end of the workshop, you'll not only understand how these tools function but also feel confident using them
                        for real-world challenges. Whether your goal is to boost productivity, enhance communication, or spark innovation,
                        these sessions provide a hands-on introduction to the possibilities of AI.

                    <p class="text-slate-400">
                        Artificial Intelligence is not just a tool we use—it is becoming a partner in how we live, work, and think. From
                        medical diagnostics to personalized education, AI is entering spaces that affect our most personal decisions and
                        daily routines. Its influence is likely to expand further as systems become more capable and adaptive.
                    
                        The workplace of the future will see tasks reshaped rather than simply replaced. Routine and repetitive work may be
                        automated, freeing people for more creative or strategic roles, but also demanding new skills and adaptability.
                        Entire sectors—such as healthcare, transportation, and entertainment—will continue to evolve as AI integrates more
                        deeply into their processes.
                    
                        At the same time, these changes raise important social and ethical questions. How do we ensure AI serves human
                        values? Who benefits most from its advances? What risks need to be addressed? Imagining the human-AI future means
                        not only looking at the opportunities ahead but also preparing thoughtfully for the challenges they bring.
