We are a non-profit, non-commercial association with 60 members. Our mission is to provide a balanced perspective on AI and its impact on work, creativity, and social life. We believe people should be well-informed about AI and how it can be used, while also being mindful of the potential consequences of its widespread adoption, including possible risks and negative effects.
