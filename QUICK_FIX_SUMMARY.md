## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### Issue: Encyclopedia Pages Had Wrong Asset Paths

**Symptoms from logs:**
```
"GET /pages/assets/css/tailwind.css?v=2" Error (404)
"GET /sv/assets/css/tailwind.css?v=2" Error (404)
```

**Root Cause:** Encyclopedia index pages were not going up enough directory levels to reach `/assets/`.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `src/content/pages/encyclopedia.index.js`
- English: Changed `assetsPrefix` from `'..'` → `'../..'`
- Swedish: Changed `assetsPrefix` from `'../..'` → `'../../..'`
- Swedish: Fixed home link from `../../index.html` → `../../../index.html`

## 📊 PostgreSQL Log Analysis

The PostgreSQL messages you saw are **NORMAL**:

```
database system was not properly shut down; automatic recovery in progress
redo done at 0/1B67D68
database system is ready to accept connections ✅
```

This happens when Docker containers restart. PostgreSQL successfully recovered and is now operational.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild Locally (Optional - to verify)
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Commit and Deploy
```bash
git add src/content/pages/encyclopedia.index.js public/favicon.ico
git commit -m "Fix: Correct encyclopedia asset paths and add root favicon"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Wait for Dokploy Rebuild
Dokploy will automatically:
- Detect the push
- Rebuild the site
- Generate encyclopedia pages with correct paths
- Export database content

### 4. Verify
After deployment, visit:
- https://app.aimuseum.site/pages/encyclopedia/
- https://app.aimuseum.site/sv/pages/encyclopedia/

Assets should load without 404 errors.

## 📝 Files Changed

1. **`src/content/pages/encyclopedia.index.js`** - Fixed asset path prefixes
2. **`public/favicon.ico`** - Added to reduce browser 404s (optional)

---

## 💡 Remaining Non-Issues

### Favicon 404 from `/favicon.ico`
- **Status:** Browsers auto-request this, but you have proper favicons in `/favicon/`
- **Impact:** None - just noise in logs
- **Fixed:** Added `public/favicon.ico` to reduce log clutter

### Strange `/index.html/admin` Errors
- **Status:** User navigation errors or stale bookmarks
- **Impact:** None - not a code issue
- **Action:** None needed
